1. Easier Project Setup and Maintenance
Zero Configuration Startup: Vamsi's RWC allows you to start a new React project without configuring Webpack, Babel, or ESLint.
2. Development Server
Hot Module Replacement (HMR): React Fast Refresh is integrated for instant feedback on code changes without losing component state.
HTTPS Support: Easy HTTPS setup for local development.
   HMR allows you to exchange, add, or remove modules while an application is running, without a full reload. This can significantly speed up development.
   # Key Changes for HMR:
    Webpack HMR Plugin: The webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin() is added to the plugins array to enable HMR.

    Dev Server Configuration: The devServer configuration now includes hot: true to enable HMR. The contentBase option is updated to static to align with the latest Webpack Dev Server API, if necessary, depending on your Webpack Dev Server version.

    React Fast Refresh (Optional but Recommended for React): While HMR keeps the application state between updates, React Fast Refresh provides an improved hot reloading experience specifically for React function components by retaining their state. To use React Fast Refresh, you'll need to install and configure an additional Babel plugin:
